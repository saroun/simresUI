see "doc/simres-release-notes.pdf" for the list of changes, bug fixes etc..
see "doc/simres-guide.pdf" for documentation to the current release

===============
version 6.5
===============
As of version 6.5, SIMRES source code is distributed via GitHub. 
With the move to git repositories, the structure of the binary and source 
packages has changed significantly. The functionality remains the same 
as for version 6.4.

===============
version 6.4
===============
- Improved MCPL functionality (import/export neutrons)
- Binding with McStas using MCPL (see doc/simres-guide.pdf)
- Export of sample scattering events (see demo/STRESSPEC)
- New demo examples (choose demo on startup)
- New sets of supermirror lookup tables for various models
- Simulation of guide misalignment
- Improved guide waviness model
- Hollow sample shapes (set wall thickness parameter)
- Improved stability and monitoring of the simulation kernel
- 64 bit binaries

===============
version 6.3.5
===============
- New sources: ESS butterfly, ISIS
- Export to MCPL file (use command MCPL)
- Choice of gonio-stage order for component positioning
- Recording of events in guides: m-value, escape coating, escape

===============
version 6.3
===============
- updated user guide (PDF)
- console command - running simulations on a remote server
- new source definitions for ESS baseline 2013 and pancake moderators
- SGUIDE: manual (free shape) or automatic (elliptic, parabolic) shape setting 
- new bug fixes (see simres-relaese-notes.pdf)

===============
version 6.2
===============
- new user guide (PDF)
- console command - running simulations on a remote server
- new source definitions for ESS baseline 2013 and pancake moderators
- new components:
  SGUIDE: free shape multisegment guide (quadratic or straight segments)
		manual or automatic (elliptic, parabolic) shape setting 
  MONITOR: beam monitor with mask area, shows successful rays at any place
	         various modes of 2D mask in x,y,kx,... useful for instr. optimization
- strain gradients for polycrytsalline samples			 
- choice of beam monitor to be used with BEAM1D,BEAM2D commands
- list of mirror tables located in home/.simres/tables
- without table, mirror reflectivity for SGUIDE is analytical (parameters are given in sguide dialog)
- bug fixes (see simres-relaese-notes.pdf)

============
version 6.1
============
- ToF components (disc chopper, wide-angle ToF detector, pulsed sources)  
- tools for powder diffractometers:
  event-based evaluation of difractograms from both position and time
  multi-peak powder sample
  evaluation of figures-of-merit from diffractograms
- particle swarm optimization (PSO)
- extended library of crystal reflections
- users projects management (storing user data in user's home directory)
- console version (run java ./GUI/simresCON.jar -h for help)
- new demo project (ToF powder diffractometer) demonstrating the new features
- many small bug fixes
============
version 6.0
============
- radial source distribution (see setup/hcs_radial.dat)
- XTAL component (bent crystal with multiple reflections)
- graphical user interface
- 3D visualisation
- free definition of instrument layout
- 1D and 2D scans with any instrument parameter
- script recorder / runner
- instrument definition and simulation options in XML files 
- new matrix description of instrument optics
  (automatic sampling optimization)
- options for upstream or downstream tracing
