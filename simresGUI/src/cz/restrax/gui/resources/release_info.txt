see "simres-guide.pdf" for documentation to the current release

===============
version 6.3.5
===============
- New sources: ESS butterfly, ISIS
- Export to MCPL file (use command MCPL)
- Choice of gonio-stage order for component positioning
- Recording of events in guides: m-value, escape coating, escape

===============
version 6.3
===============
- updated user guide (PDF)
- console command - running simulations on a remote server
- new source definitions for ESS baseline 2013 and pancake moderators
- SGUIDE: manual (free shape) or automatic (elliptic, parabolic) shape setting 
- new bug fixes (see simres-relaese-notes.pdf)

===============
version 6.2
===============
- new user guide (PDF)
- console command - running simulations on a remote server
- new source definitions for ESS baseline 2013 and pancake moderators
- new components:
  SGUIDE: free shape multisegment guide (quadratic or straight segments)
		manual or automatic (elliptic, parabolic) shape setting 
  MONITOR: beam monitor with mask area, shows successful rays at any place
	         various modes of 2D mask in x,y,kx,... useful for instr. optimization
- strain gradients for polycrytsalline samples			 
- choice of beam monitor to be used with BEAM1D,BEAM2D commands
- list of mirror tables located in home/.simres/tables
- without table, mirror reflectivity for SGUIDE is analytical (parameters are given in sguide dialog)
- bug fixes (see simres-relaese-notes.pdf)
